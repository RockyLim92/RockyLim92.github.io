</p>

My name is Heerak Lim and in English it is called Rocky. I'm in my M.S degree at Seoul National University in Korea and studying computer science. I worked for CSIRO, a national research organisation in Australia as a intern, and AICT(Advanced Institutes of Convergence Technology) in Korea as a research intern as well. Among the various fields of computer science, I am interested in embedded systems, sensor network, and distributed computing system. This blog is mainly a place where I record small accomplishments I have made on such research topics. Plus, I'm gonna post whatever Iâ€™ve designed, published, developed, coded, or literally whatever!<br /><br />cheers,
