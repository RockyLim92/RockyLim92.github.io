# Experimental Evaluation

My experimental setup consists of test PC equipped with an Intel ~~ , 8GB of DDR3 RAM, an Open-Channel SSD (CNEX Labs Westlake SDK) with 2TB NAND MLC FLASH.

The host runs Ubuntu 14.04 with Linux Kernel 4.12-12+ and pblk patches applied.

Above tables contain a general characterization for the evaluated Open-Channel SSD. Per-PU sequential read and write bandwidth were gathered experimentally through a modified version of fio that uses the PPA I/O interface and issues vector I/Os directly to the device. The pblk factory state and steady state (where garbage collection is active) are measured experimentally through standard fio on top of pblk. [1]
